    "You've just joined a team of astronomers exploring the wonders of our solar system. Eager to contribute, you've been tasked with analyzing data about the planets, their sizes, and the number of moons they possess. However, there's a catch: the data is scattered across different files and formats, and you've never used Jupyter Notebooks before! The astronomers, excited about the potential of this interactive tool, have asked you to learn how to use it while tackling this data analysis task.\n",

    "## Activity Recap: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You learned about the interactive nature of Jupyter Notebooks and how they combine code, text, and visualizations for data exploration and analysis. Here is a recap of some of the key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code Cells: You executed your first Python code cell, printing the classic \"Hello, World!\" message.\n",
    "* Libraries and Packages: You understood the importance of libraries like numpy for extending Python's capabilities.\n",
    "* numpy: You imported numpy and used it to perform a simple calculation on an array of numbers.\n",
    "* CSV Files: You learned how to read CSV files into a DataFrame using pandas.\n",
    "* Data Analysis: You combined CSV data with numpy to calculate descriptive statistics.\n",
    "* Visualization: You used seaborn to create a scatter plot, visualizing the relationship between two variables in your data."
